  This article introduces the R package placeholdR, which executes parametric survival analysis
  techniques similar to those in Minitab. The functions available in this package carry out basic
  survival analysis techniques. Among these are plotting hazard, cumulative hazard, and survival
  curves, based on specified parametric distributions, computing survival probabilites, and
  computing summary statistics. We describe appropriate usage of these functions, what the output
  means, and provide examples of how to utilizie this functions in real-world datasets.

\citep{R}, or cite a reference such as \citet{R} in the text.

## Section title in sentence case

This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{figure:rlogo}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics{Rlogo}
  \caption{The logo of R.}
  \label{figure:rlogo}
\end{figure}

## Another section

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
