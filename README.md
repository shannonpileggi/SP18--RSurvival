## Summer Research, 2018

#### _Students:_ Ashley Jacobson and Victor Wilson

#### _Faculty advisor:_ Shannon Pileggi

### Objective

The objective of this summer research is to create an R package that can execute parametric survival analysis techniques similar to those in Minitab.

### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository which contains the following:**

1.  An R package for the survival functions.

2.  A log of hours spent on the summer research by each student, which includes date, hours, and activity summary.

3.  A presentation to the Statistics Department.

4.  A presentation at the CSM annual research conference.

5.  A manuscript to submit to the [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/) detailing the work and submit an abstract to the [RStudio Conference](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)

### Specific Aims

**1.  Utilize GitHub to collaborate on project materials and updates.**

  * Karl Broman's [github tutorial](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/)

  * Jenny Bryan's [Happy git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) 
  
  * DataCamp's [Introduction to git for data science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) course


**2.  Adhere to good programming practices:**
  
  * Write all R code according to [Hadley Wickam's Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
  
  * Use the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) for an additional reference
  
  * Learn about how to write R functions from DataCamp's [Writing functions in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r) course 
  
  * Use Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book as a reference (Ch19 also discusses functions)
  
  **3.  Create an R package that contains survival functions.**

  *  DataCamp's [R Packages: A Beginner's Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide)
    
  *  Hillary Parker's [Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
  
  *  Hadley Wickham's [R pacakges](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book.
  
   **4.  Provide documentation for the R package.**

  *  Use the [roxygen package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) to document code.
  
  *  Write a [vignette](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html) to accompany the package.
  
  *  Consider using [pkgdown]((http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html)) to create a website.
