#' Data on time until reincarceration for 194 inmates.
#'
#' Henning and Frueh (1996) followed criminal activities of 194 inmates released from a medium
#' security prison for 36 months. The data from this study can be used to investigate the time
#' until the former inmates were re-arrested. If the former inmate had been re-arrested for
#' a criminal act before 36 months (after initial prison release) had passed, then that former
#' inmate’s event time was complete. If the former inmate had not been re-arrested for a
#' criminal act after 36 months had passed, or had completely dropped out of the study, then
#' that former inmate’s event time was right censored.

#'   such as aggravated assault or kidnapping}
#'   \item{Property}{a dichotomous variable indicating whether former inmates were convicted
#'   of a property-related crime (property = 1)}
#'   \item{Cenage}{the “centered” age of individual, i.e. the difference between the age of the
#'   individual upon release and the average age of all inmates in the study.}
