\description{
Henning and Frueh (1996) followed criminal activities of 194 inmates released from a medium
security prison for 36 months. The data from this study can be used to investigate the time
until the former inmates were re-arrested. If the former inmate had been re-arrested for
a criminal act before 36 months (after initial prison release) had passed, then that former
inmate’s event time was complete. If the former inmate had not been re-arrested for a
criminal act after 36 months had passed, or had completely dropped out of the study, then
that former inmate’s event time was right censored.
